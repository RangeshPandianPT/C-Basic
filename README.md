🧠 Learning C++

I’m currently learning C++, a powerful and versatile programming language known for:

🔧 Speed and performance — used in game engines, real-time systems, and large-scale applications

🧱 Object-oriented programming — supports classes, inheritance, polymorphism

🔁 Low-level control — gives access to memory management and hardware-level operations

🌐 Wide applications — used in systems programming, competitive programming, and high-performance software

Here’s what I’ve covered so far:

✅ Variables, data types, operators

✅ Conditional statements (if, switch)

✅ Loops (for, while)

✅ Functions and arrays

✅ Basic object-oriented programming (class, object)

🔜 Coming up: Pointers, file handling, STL, and more advanced topics!
